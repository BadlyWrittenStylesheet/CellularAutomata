# My awful approach at creating a simulation
## Made with HTML5 canvas and JS

### Some future plans:
- Nicer editor ( making lines, holding the mouse button and such )
- Saving in local storage
- Loading from local storage
- Loading from file
- Making your own conditions for cells
- Fun little stuff, like changing the colors

  For now that's all, I hope that this proejct won't die like many of mine
