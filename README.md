# My awful approach at creating a simulation
## Made with HTML5 canvas and JS

## Available at [

### Some future plans:
- Importing files with canvas.width canvas.height and 0s / 1s for the canvas true/false cells
- Nicer editor
- Saving in local storage
- Making your own conditions for cells
- Fun little stuff, like changing the colors

  For now that's all, I hope that this proejct won't die like many of mine
